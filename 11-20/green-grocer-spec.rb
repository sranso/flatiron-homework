##Skills: 
any?, all?, none?, each, map/collect

##Instructions:
Code generates a random cart of items and a random set of coupons. Implement a method checkout to calculate total cost of a cart of items and apply discounts and coupons as necessary.

##Code:

```ruby
#ITEMS = [  {"AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.00, :clearance => true}},
#			{"KALE" => {:price => 3.00,:clearance => false}},
#			{"BLACK_BEANS" => {:price => 2.50,:clearance => false}},
#			{"ALMONDS" => {:price => 9.00, :clearance => false}},
#			{"TEMPEH" => {:price => 3.00,:clearance => true}},
#			{"CHEESE" => {:price => 6.50,:clearance => false}},
#			{"BEER" => {:price => 13.00, :clearance => false}},
#			{"PEANUTBUTTER" => {:price => 3.00,:clearance => true}},
#			{"BEETS" => {:price => 2.50,:clearance => false}}]
#
#COUPS = [	{:item=>"AVOCADO", :num=>2, :cost=>5.00},
#			{:item=>"BEER", :num=>2, :cost=>20.00},
#			{:item=>"CHEESE", :num=>3, :cost=>15.00}]
#
##randomly generates a cart of items
#def generateCart
#	cart = []
#	rand(20).times do
#		cart.push(ITEMS.sample)  
#	end
#	cart
#end
#
##randomly generates set of coupons
#def generateCoups
#	coups = []
#	rand(2).times do
#		coups.push(COUPS.sample)
#	end
#	coups
#end
#
##the cart is currently an array of individual items, translate it into a hash that includes the counts for each item
  For example if your cart was [  {"AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.00, :clearance => true}}, {"AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.00, :clearance => true}}]
  it would become {"AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.00, :clearance => true}, :count => 2}
##create a checkout method that calculates the total cost of the cart
##when checking out, check the coupons and apply the discount if the proper number of items is present
##if any of the items are on clearance add a 20% discount
##if the customer has 2 of the same coupon, triple the discount
##if none of the items purchased have a unit price greater than 5$ give the customer a 10$ discount off the whole cart
